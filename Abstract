Challenge Name:  DC WMATA Metro ridership dataset
Upon analyzing the DC WMATA Metro ridership dataset, our team aims to uncover 
key trends, patterns, and outliers in metro usage across different time periods, 
days of the week, and seasons. By utilizing exploratory data analysis and data 
visualization techniques, we will examine how factors including time of day, 
part of the week, and seasonal factors impact ridership across different metro 
stations. Beyond general trends, we also aim to explore how major events impact 
metro usage, asking questions such as: Do ridership numbers spike near Capital 
One Arena during hockey or basketball games? Do stations near the National Mall 
see increased traffic during the Cherry Blossom Festival?

To address these questions, we will develop histograms and geospatial maps to 
analyze ridership patterns. Our methodology involves creating CSV files 
categorizing data by time of day and station location. The geospatial maps will 
visualize metro station activity, with point sizes representing average 
ridership across selected days. We hypothesize that peak travel hours will have 
the highest ridership, stations near cultural landmarks will see increased 
weekend traffic, and colder months will lead to decreased late-night ridership 
compared to summer.

Our results will provide valuable insights into metro travel patterns, 
assisting transit planners, policymakers, and organizations like MindPetal 
in better understanding public transit trends. By leveraging data-driven 
analysis, we aim to contribute to enhancing metro services and transportation 
planning based on ridership demand and external factors.
